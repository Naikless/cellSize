% POSTSHOCK Calculate the post shock state of a shock moving with velocity
% shockSpeed into the downstream state described by downstream.
%
% Internal calculation assumes the shock moves to the left, so shockSpeed
% should be negative.
%
% The returned state is in the wave reference frame and must be converted
% back to the lab frame to actually put it to use, using
%  ps = SetVelocity(ps, ps(2)/ps(1) + shockSpeed)

% Transform the downstream state into the wave coordinate system

% TODO 3 is kind of an arbitrary initial guess for œÅ. Better do an initial guess!
